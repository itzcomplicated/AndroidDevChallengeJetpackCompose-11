## :scroll: Description
This app lists a set of dog breeds and their brief information in detail.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Having a new tool kit frame work to replace current one is challenging and exiting at the same time. Was waiting for jetpack compose to be stable for some time
Can't stop myself from trying it out once its available. This seems to be a cool way of exploring the new jetpack compose.
